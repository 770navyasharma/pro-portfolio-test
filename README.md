# Navya Sharma - Web Developer Portfolio

## Summary
This project delivers a modern, single-page portfolio website for web developer Navya Sharma. Built with Bootstrap 5, it showcases her profile, skills, and projects in a responsive and clean design. The site includes essential sections such as Home, About Me, and My Projects, providing an accessible and professional online presence.

## Setup
This project is a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website. Therefore, no local setup, build tools, or special server dependencies are required to run it. You can simply open the `index.html` file directly in any modern web browser, or access the live deployed version.

## Usage
To view Navya Sharma's portfolio, simply navigate to its deployed URL (if available) or open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The navigation bar at the top provides quick links to different sections of the page:
*   **Home**: Introduction to Navya Sharma.
*   **About**: Details about her skills and expertise.
*   **Projects**: A showcase of her work.

Clicking on these links will smoothly scroll you to the respective section on the single page.

## Code Explanation

### HTML (`index.html`)
The core structure of the portfolio is defined in `index.html`. It utilizes semantic HTML5 elements (`<nav>`, `<section>`) to organize the content logically. Bootstrap 5 classes are extensively used throughout for responsive layout (e.g., `container`, `row`, `col`), a sticky navigation bar, and component styling (such as cards for project placeholders). Each major section (`About Me`, `My Projects`) is assigned a unique `id` attribute, enabling the navigation bar to link directly to these parts of the page for smooth in-page scrolling.

### CSS
Styling is primarily handled by Bootstrap 5, which provides a modern, consistent, and responsive look and feel. Bootstrap's utility classes are leveraged for spacing, typography, colors, and responsive design. Any custom styling is minimal and uses basic inline CSS for specific elements if needed, adhering to Bootstrap's design principles to maintain a clean and professional aesthetic.

### JavaScript
The project incorporates Bootstrap 5's JavaScript bundle to provide interactive components. This is primarily used for the responsive navigation bar's toggler functionality on smaller screens, ensuring the menu collapses and expands correctly. No custom JavaScript is implemented beyond Bootstrap's dependencies, as the site is designed to be static and presentational.
